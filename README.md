# BlindSpot

BlindSpot is a RESTful API server and web application built with the MEAN stack. The general idea is for a user to be able to edit their own profile information using one link and being able to share with others using another.

The code is based on and modified from the Heroku tutorial here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api.

*This application is still in progress*  
Currently deployed: https://enigmatic-wildwood-52602.herokuapp.com/#/
